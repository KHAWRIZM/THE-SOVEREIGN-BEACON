# 🛡️ SECURITY POLICY

## Reporting a Vulnerability?
We don't use the cloud, so we don't have cloud vulnerabilities.
If you find a bug in the code, **fix it yourself** and send a Pull Request.
That is the Sovereign Way.

## Trust Level
- **Zero Trust** in Corporate Clouds.
- **Full Trust** in Open Source.

*We are the firewall.*
