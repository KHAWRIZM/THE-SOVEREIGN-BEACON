# 🧠 ADVANCED SOVEREIGNTY: BEYOND THE BASICS

Science never stops. Here is how to take total control.

## 1. The Onion Router (Tor)
- Don't just use a browser. Route your Beacon through Tor to become truly invisible.
- Edit your 	orrc file to host a Hidden Service (.onion).

## 2. Docker Sovereignty
- Instead of installing apps, run them in containers.
- Clean, isolated, and easy to destroy in an emergency.

## 3. The Backup Rule (3-2-1)
- 3 Copies of your data.
- 2 Different media types (HDD + SSD).
- 1 Off-site location (Encrypted USB at a friend's house).

*Knowledge is the only wealth they cannot tax.*
