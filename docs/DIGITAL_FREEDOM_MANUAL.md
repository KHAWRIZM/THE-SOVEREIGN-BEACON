# 📘 THE MANUAL OF DIGITAL FREEDOM

## 1. Why are you here?
Because you are tired of being a product.

## 2. How to protect yourself?
- **Stop using Chrome.** Use Firefox or Brave.
- **Stop using Google Search.** Use DuckDuckGo or StartPage.
- **Stop renting servers.** Build your own Beacon.

## 3. The Sovereign Pledge
I will not trade my privacy for convenience.
I will not let an algorithm decide what I see.
I am human, and I am free.
